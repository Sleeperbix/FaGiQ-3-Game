            "AnswerC": "Ultraviolet",
            "AnswerD": "Visible Light",
            "CorrectAnswer": "Gamma Rays",
            "AnswerFact": "Gamma Rays have the shortest wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum, typically less than 0.01 nanometers. Ascending in length, the order is Gamma Rays, X-Rays, Ultraviolet, Visible Light, Infrared, Microwaves and Radio Waves as the longest",

            "CorrectAnswer": "Magnetism",
            "AnswerFact": "A Gauss Meter, also known as a Magnetometer, is a device used to measure the strength and direction of a magnetic field. Radiation is measured with a Geiger Counter, whilst the other two answers don't have a specific tool for measuring them.",
